### Description
An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Windows Certificate Dialog when it does not properly enforce user privileges. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run processes in an elevated context. An attacker could then install programs; view, change or delete data. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take control of an affected system. The security update addresses the vulnerability by ensuring Windows Certificate Dialog properly enforces user privileges.
