### AD DS Schema

Active Directory (AD) schema is a blueprint that describes the rules about the type of objects that can be stored in the AD as well as the attributes related to these objects. The schema thus defines the content, and the structure of the object classes, and the object attributes used to create an object. While creating a new object, the AD references the classes defined in the schema and utilizes the retrieved information to create the object.


### AD Domains

In Active Directory terms, a **domain is an area of a network organized by a single authentication database**. In other words, an Active Directory domain is essentially a logical grouping of objects on a network. Domains are created so IT teams can establish administrative boundaries between different network entities. There’s no limit to the number of objects you can add into an AD domain, and objects don’t need to be in the same physical location to be grouped together.

Active Directory domains are controlled by a tool called the domain controller. **The domain controller acts as a domain authority, meaning it’s responsible for all Active Directory object permissions, authentications, modifications, and edits in a domain.** AD domains are usually identified via a domain name system (DNS). Usually the DNS is the same as a company’s public domain name, although sometimes there are alternate subdomain names.

### AD Tree

An Active Directory tree is **a collection of domains within a Microsoft Active Directory network**. The term refers to the fact that each domain has exactly one parent, leading to a hierarchical tree structure. A group of Active Directory trees is known as a forest.

### AD Forests

An **Active Directory Forest** is the collection of more than one domain trees having different name spaces or roots. This means that the forest contains a number of domain trees that do not share a common name space, or more so, do not have the same parent domain.

### Organizational Units (OU)

An organizational unit (OU) is a subdivision within an Active Directory into which you can place users, groups, computers, and other organizational units. The term "organizational unit" is often shortened to "OU" in casual conversation. "Container" is also often applied in its place, even in Microsoft's own documentation. All terms are considered correct and interchangeable.

### AD Trusts

The users can access to other domains in the same forests because they are linked by connections called Trusts.
A trust is a connection from a domain to another. Not a physical network connection, but a kind of authentication/authorization connection. You may be able to reach computers on the network that are in others domains, but you cannot log in on those computers with your user of this domain. That is what a trust allows you to do.

**A trust is a directed relation where one side is the trusting and the other the trusted. When this link is established, the users of the trusted domain can access to the resources of the trusting domain.**

**Moreover, a trust can be transitive or nontransitive. A nontransitive trust can only be used by the two sides of the trust, the trusting and the trusted. Whereas a transitive trust can act as a bridge and being used for third domains connected with the domains that are connected by the transitive trust.**
