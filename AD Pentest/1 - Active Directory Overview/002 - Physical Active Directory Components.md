A **Domain Controller** is a server (most commonly Microsoft Active Directory) that manages network and identity security, effectively acting as the gatekeeper for user authentication and authorization to IT resources within the domain. Domain controllers are particularly relevant in Microsoft directory services terminology, and function as the primary mode for authenticating Windows user identities to Windows-based systems, applications, file servers, and networks. 

### AD DS Data Store

A directory service, such as **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**, provides the methods for storing directory data and making this data available to network users and administrators. For example, AD DS stores information about user accounts, such as names, passwords, phone numbers, and so on, and enables other authorized users on the same network to access this information
This data store, also known as the directory, contains information about Active Directory objects. These objects typically include shared resources such as servers, volumes, printers, and the network user and computer accounts
