### What is IDOR
Insecure Direct Object References occur when an application provides direct access to objects based on user-supplied input. This will allow a malicious attacker to access data belonging to other users by manipulating the request

### Looking for IDOR
1. Understand how the application works:
	-> How does it fetch data
	-> How does it create new data
	-> How does it delete or modify data
2. Look for any numerical IDs in the request 
3. Create two users in order to have accurate data( userID, objectID, etc)
4. Sometimes application use "encryption" to obfuscate information such as the userid (such as base64)
5. Automate using burp

### Exercise

We can see that this has a update form of some kind and their are some details autofilled but when we click update nothing happens so lets open devtools and go to network tab and look for all requests and reload the page

We can see a `api` request which can be detected as the type is `xhr` usually idors can be found in api calls

We can see that it is the same information on the update page so lets change the number from 12 to 1

We can see that we can view other users information unauthenticated
