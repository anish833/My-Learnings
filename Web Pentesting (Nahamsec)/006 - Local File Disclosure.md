### What is LFD
The File Disclosure Vulnerability allows an attacker to include a file, usually exploiting a "dynamic file read" mechanisms implemented in the target application. The vulnerability occurs due to the use of user-supplied input without proper validation

  -> Allows to read configuration files on host machine
  -> Read Arbitary files on the box (like /etc/passwd)
  -> Information Disclosure (limited to host's root directory) in some cases

  ### Exercise

  We can see that this web page just have cat pictures and no link to open. Lets open the cat pictures
  
  ![[Pasted image 20211118182935.png]]
  
  We can see the url that it is fetching cat pictures from some location locally. Lets try to put `/etc/passwd` in that and try
  
  ![[Pasted image 20211118183043.png]]
  
  It says file not found. It can be because of 2 reasons
     -> If we are in a hardcoded directory so we have to break out to the root directory
	 -> If they are expecting extensions so we might have to use null byte injections to bypass it
	 
But the page is also using `.gif` files so it is not expecting extensions so just do a path traversal
