### Open Redirect
Open redirects happens when the web application takes an untrusted input and redirects a user from the web application to untrusted site or resources that will be used further for malicious purposes

The impact of Open Redirect is usually low, unless you are using it to escalate other vulnerabilities

Sometimes the application may have some security measures in place where the developers define a list of either trusted or untrusted resources. In some cases, you may be able to bypass it, if you fully understand how it works

#### Some bypasses

### Hunting for Open Redirect
For example we have a website like this

![[Pasted image 20211116190920.png]]

We can see that there is a link of google which if we click it redirects to google.com. But in the url it doesn't disclose anything so lets see the devtools and analyse the request

![[Pasted image 20211116191115.png]]

We see that when we click on the google link it uses a variable `redirect=` and the url of google.com for redirection

```bash
URL : http://or1.nahamsec.thm?redirect=http://www.google.com
```

If we put a different url in the `redirect` variable it will forward the request to the url we supplied

Here we changed the `redirect` variable to forward to different url and it does the work

### Bypass whitelisting on openredirect
We will take the same website but now developers have whitelisted the domain we visit i.e., only google.com can be visited. So in this type of scenario one can use `@` which is a functionality of a browser for redirection. For example

![[Pasted image 20211116192211.png]]

If we have something like this it will go to `yahoo.com` . This the functionality of `@`. So in open redirects we can use this functionality for our benifit.

![[Pasted image 20211116192336.png]]

Here we can see that the `example.com` is not allowed for redirect so we can craft the url something like this

```bash
URL : http://or2.nahamsec.thm?redirect=http://www.google.com@example.com
```

And this will bypass the whitelisting
