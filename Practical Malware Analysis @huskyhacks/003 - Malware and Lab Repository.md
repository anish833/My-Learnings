### Safety Always

-> The malware should be followed by an extension which doesn't have a execution property for e.g., `.malz`
-> The malware then should be zipped with a password e.g., `infected`
-> Make sure the VM is cut off from the internet and the Host Computer
-> Network adapter should be in a different subnet
